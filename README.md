# File-Name-Randomize-Order

This a basic app created to optimize the proccess of renaming files to order them randomly, by assigning a random number to the beginning of each file's name in the chosen directory

This is done simply by running the app on the terminal, then it asks to type the directory's path, after that the app does the rest and it's done, the files have each been assigned a number to the beginning of their original names
